This is a jQuery plugin that adds a Twitter (tm) style  "characters remaining"
display to an html text input element such as <input> or <textarea>.

This html snippet shows how to apply the plugin to a <textarea> element:

<html>
<head>
<script src='jQuery.1.7.1.js' type='text/javascript'></script>
<script src='remainingCharacters.js' type='text/javascript'></script>
</head>
<body>
<div id="charsLeftTarget"></div>
<textarea id="charsLeft"></textarea>
<script type="text/javascript">
	$().ready(function(){
		$('#charsLeft').remainingCharacters($('#charsLeftTarget'),140);
	});
</script>
</body>
</html>

It's been tested against jQuery 1.7.1 and IT WORKS ON MY MACHINE.  If you find
a bug submit an issue.  If you know how to  fix an issue feel free to  fork it
and  submit  a pull request.   I'll gladly check it out and merge if your code
if it's appropriate.

CHANGE HISTORY

v1.0.0
The plugin now takes a reference to the target  element to use for  displaying
the number of characters remaining and how many characters to allow.   It also
restricts the user from actually entering too many characters.
