This is a jQuery plugin that adds a Twitter (tm) style  "characters remaining"
display to an html text input element such as <input> or <textarea>.

Right now, the only real problem I have with this plugin, and for me it's  not
a show-stopper, is that if  the user  enters  exactly  the maximum  number  of
characters, the enter key is disabled, preventing it from being used to submit
the form.  If it's used on a <textarea> [enter] can't be used for that purpose
anyway.  However, it should still  be allowed on  <input> elements.  I need to
figure out how to let the plugin  detect if it's an  <input> or <textarea> and
handle the enter key appropriately.

CHANGE HISTORY

v1.0.0
The plugin now takes a reference to the target  element to use for  displaying
the number of characters remaining and how many characters to allow.   It also
restricts the user from actually entering too many characters.
