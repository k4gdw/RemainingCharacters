This is a jQuery plugin that adds a Twitter (tm) style  "characters remaining"
display to an html text input element such as <input> or <textarea>.

This html snippet shows how to apply the plugin to a <textarea> element:

<html>
<head>
<script src='jQuery.1.7.1.js' type='text/javascript'></script>
<script src='remainingCharacters.js' type='text/javascript'></script>
</head>
<body>
<div id="charsLeftTarget"></div>
<textarea id="charsLeft"></textarea>
<script type="text/javascript">
	$().ready(function(){
		$('#charsLeft').remainingCharacters({
			target: output,
			maxChars: 144,
			hideTarget: true,
			fadeTarget: {
				fade: true,
				speed: 'slow'
			}
		});
	});
</script>
</body>
</html>

It's been tested against jQuery 1.7.1 and IT WORKS ON MY MACHINE.  If you find
a bug submit an issue.  If you know how to  fix an issue feel free to  fork it
and  submit  a pull request.   I'll gladly check it out and merge your code if
it's appropriate.

CHANGE HISTORY

v2.1.6
Fixed bug that prevented user from tabbing off of a filled up textbox.

v2.1.5
Missed moving some of the 2.1.4 changes into the vsdoc file.

v2.1.4
Fixed the incorrect initialization issue, for real this time.

v2.1.2
Rolling back the "fix" applied in v2.1.1.  It broke something and I'm not sure
what.

v2.1.1
Fixed a bug that caused a textbox that was populated from a database to show an
incorrect character count until the user actually starts typing.

v2.1.0
Changed the NuGet package to install the latest jQuery  instead  of  using the
complicated dependency resolution system NuGet uses by default.   Also added a
minified version.

v2.0.0
Added the ability to optionally hide the output and show it when the text  box
receives focus, the hide it again when the user leaves the textbox.  This  was
a major version bump because I was starting to need more  and more  parameters
so it became easier to just accept an "args" parameter which is  a  javascript
literal object as described above.   This  will  make  it  easier  to  add new
parameters in future versions without breaking backward compatibility.

v1.0.1
Fixing the issue where enter is disabled  if the user  hits the maximum number
of characters.

v1.0.0
The plugin now takes a reference to the target  element to use for  displaying
the number of characters remaining and how many characters to allow.   It also
restricts the user from actually entering too many characters.

v0.1.0
